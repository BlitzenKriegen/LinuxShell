  Module: Directory Commands

  Purpose: The directory module is meant to
  catalog and hold to functions to perform directory-
  level commands within the shell implementations, such
  as creating/destroying a directory and changing directory.

  Details: The module is activated by a call to one of its
  functions in the shell prompt, which then passes in the
  arguements made by the user to to program, which would then
  process them.
