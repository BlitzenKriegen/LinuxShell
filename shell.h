  Module: Shell

  Purpose: The shell module is meant to hold the nominal
  shell program that faces outward towards the user. When the
  user inputs a command, the shell module will process the input
  and then delegate the given command to the relavent module "family"
  (i.e the file module for a file command, directory module for a dir
  command, etc).

  Details: The module awaits user input and the processes their input.
  (FINISH LATER).
